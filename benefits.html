          <h2>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO LEARN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING?</h2>
          Having some literacy in coding can help you in many types of jobs. And just as learning to write doesn’t force you into becoming an author or journalist, learning how to code doesn’t mean you have to become a programmer. Even a basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, or SQL will make you a more efficient salesperson, designer, or marketer.

          Plus, software is becoming more and more common in everything we do. Could you have imagined a few years ago that you’d use a smartphone to find a date or flag down a car? The more you understand computers, the more power you will have over your environment.
          
          Gaining new ways of thinking might be one of the best benefits of learning programming languages. How often do we think systematically in our daily lives? Just one class in programming can discipline your mind to find the cause of problems, pull apart processes, and create solutions, even if you never become a coder.
          
          
          <h2>Benefits of learning programming</h2>
            
            <li>problem solving  ;</li>
            While code at first glance might look complicated or rigid, the truth about coding is that it’s extremely flexible. Coding is all about finding creative solutions to a problem. And if you were to present the same coding problem to a group of ten different coders, you would get ten very different codes. The end results might all be the same, but the path they used to get there would be different because each programmer would use their own unique style to find a solution to the issue. Problem-solving skills are useful in any field and are a major benefit to learning to code as a student.
          
            <li>logic and reasoning  ;</li>
            Logical thinking and reasoning are essential software developer skills. As you learn to code, you will improve your logic and reasoning skills because it is only through using logic that you will be able to create efficient, dependable code. Logic is a strength in any field because you will be able to better analyze and assess both the big picture and smaller details within a problem.

            <li>perseverance  ;</li>
            No code is ever perfect when it is first created. There are always going to be bugs, errors, and flaws within code. Coding teaches you that those errors and bugs aren’t something to run away from, but part of the process to persevere through. Coding teaches you to not give up and to keep fighting even when problems arise, which is a powerful trait to have in any career.
            
            <li>creativity  ;</li>
            All code starts from nothing and is creatively pieced together to create masterworks. Coding gives you a blank canvas to experiment with, which encourages creativity and play. Coding languages can be compared to learning French, Spanish, or any other language. Once upon a time, you learned the basic grammar rules and vocabulary for English, which enabled you to understand the rules of the language, and better communicate and share your ideas. The same is true for coding. With the fundamentals of a coding language, you open doors to more creativity and expression.
           
            <li>communication  ;</li>
            Not only does learning a new language empower you to open up a new realm of thought and expression, but it also strengthens other language skills. By learning additional grammar and sentence structures (or in the case of coding, syntax), our awareness of similar structures and aspects in our native language improves. This means that a benefit of learning to code is improving both your written and verbal communication skills.
           
            <li>positive mindset  ;</li>
            Learning how to code is difficult and can lead to tackling large-scale projects. While you might learn the basics in a few weeks or months, it can take years to become fluent and comfortable in doing it. After putting in the hard work and effort to make it a reality, it’s rewarding to step back and recognize your accomplishments. Learning how to code can teach you that you can achieve your goals no matter the size or complexity of a task.
            
            <li>marketability  ;</li>
            Coding languages are just as appealing to employers as your ability to speak another language like Spanish or Mandarin. Even in fields where coding isn’t required, achieving fluency in coding can help you stand out from the crowd and improve your chances of landing a job.
           
            <li>online presence customization  ;</li>
            A growing number of people manage personal websites. By learning how to code, you are able to customize your website to best reflect your personality and style all on your own. You’ll be able to quickly change and modify your page when you need to, which will give you the flexibility you need to represent yourself well at all times.
           
            <li>automation  ;</li>
            If your job has boring, repetitive tasks that could be easily done by a computer, why not make the computer do it? One benefit of coding is that it can help you free up time when you automate repetitive tasks, which gives you time to focus on what matters. This makes your day-to-day life easier and can help you be productive no matter which career you have.
            
            <li>community membership  ;</li>
            Even if it isn’t your full-time job, once you learn how to code, you become a member of a huge network of tech professionals that help and support each other. Coders are some of the friendliest and most helpful people you could hope to meet. Community members are always there to help each other learn and improve. Programming groups encompass everything from large, international communities to small, local organizations that you can turn to as you learn how to code.
